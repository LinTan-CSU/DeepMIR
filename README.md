# DeepMIR
There are some codes for the paper DeepMIR: A Versatile Deep Learning Method for Accurate Com-ponent Identification in Mid-Infrared Spectra of Mixtures. We developed a Deep learning-based library search method for Mid-infrared spectroscopy (DeepMIR). Other methods for comparison in the paper are also presented. The Liquid Mixture dataset is public for example applications.
# Requirements
Before running codes on your own computer, make sure you have established an environment required by this project.
## Create a Conda environment
    conda env create -f requirements.yml -n myenv
## Activate the Conda environment
    activate myenv
# Example
You can see the [example.ipynb](https://github.com/LinTan-CSU/DeepMIR/blob/main/src/example.ipynb) from the "src" folder for the utilization of DeepMIR. If you want to try the codes on your own computer, please download the whole project and the Liquid Mixture dataset from the Releases. Try other sub-datasets based on the example.ipynb. 
# Web server
A web server of [DeepMIR](https://huggingface.co/spaces/LinTan-CSU/DeepMIR) is established. Please refer to the paper for more details.
