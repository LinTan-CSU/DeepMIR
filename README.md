# DeepMIR
This are some codes for the paper DeepMIR: a versatile and accurate component identification method for high-throughput mid-infrared spectra. We developed a method named Deep learning-based library search method for Mid-infrared spectroscopy (Deep
MIR). Other methods for comparsion in the paper are also presented. Organic solvents datasets are public for an example application.
