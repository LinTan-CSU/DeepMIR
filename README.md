# DeepMIR
There are some codes associated with the paper "DeepMIR: Targeted Component Identification in Mid-Infrared Spectra of Mixtures Using a Deep Learning Model." We developed a Deep learning-based library search method for Mid-infrared spectroscopy (DeepMIR). Other methods for comparison in the paper are also presented. The Liquid Mixture dataset is public for example applications.
# Requirements
Before running the code on your computer, ensure that you have set up the required environment for this project.
## Create a Conda environment
    conda env create -f requirements.yml -n myenv
## Activate the Conda environment
    activate myenv
# Example
You can see the [example.ipynb](https://github.com/LinTan-CSU/DeepMIR/blob/main/src/example.ipynb) from the "src" folder for the utilization of DeepMIR. If you want to try the codes on your computer, please download the whole project and the Liquid Mixture dataset from the Releases. Try other sub-datasets based on the example.ipynb. 
# Web server
A web server for [DeepMIR](https://huggingface.co/spaces/LinTan-CSU/DeepMIR) has been established. Please refer to the paper for more details.
